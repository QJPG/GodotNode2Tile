# Godot Node2Tile is based on Crocotile 3d where it uses Godot's own editor to create scenarios.

## It is recommended to activate the editor's grid option to modify vertices!

Nodes:
- Brush: is a Node3D that groups and draws all tiles, in addition to defining the collision.
- BrushForm: A surface with data for a face of the model.
- Vertex Attachment: is an optional node that allows changing the shapeâ€™s vertices
